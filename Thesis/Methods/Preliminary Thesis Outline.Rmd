# Latent Class Model in the Airway Microbiome

## Introduction

### Cf relevance

Cf is most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disease in US, affecting 1 in 4000 newborns in US, and a higher rate in some european countries (Farrell 2017)

CF pulmonary disease begins early, and can progreess rapidly without early identification. (goetz 2019) 

CF leads to airways vulnerable to chronic bacterial infections, requiring repeated hospital visits, IV antibiotics, and additional care (CF org)

It is therefore important to understand the microbiome of airways within CF patients so that we can create treatment plans for patients with different airway bacterial communities.

Furthermore, identifying phenotypes based on airway microbiome community composition may help us specialize treatment for patients with these distinct phenotypes. 

Currently, multiple ways to cluster and build these phenotypes (see highlighted articles section), and it is difficult to methods/truth

### Microbiome background



### Motivating example [BONUS study]

(Goetz 2019) analyzed data from the Baby Observational and Nutritional Study (BONUS): 28 centers in US which has clinical, medication, symptomes, culture, and chest radiographs data collected repeatedly throughout the first year of life ($n\approx 200$; around 4-6 samples/subj; 1053 samples total) 

time measured in age (months) both continuous and "rounded" (if there was a patient with month 4.7 and 5.4, these months were rounded to 5 and 6)

194 infants (84%) developed a CF specific pathogen

relatively low # of taxa (could categorize into groups) 

### Why i am looking at latent class analysis

The application of latent class analysis to the microbiome is still relatively novel; not a lot of recent application, especially incorporating mixed components, to airways. 

Several papers have emphasized the utility of building latent variable models in the context of examining the true bacterial composition of a sample (Wu, Berkow 2013; daSilvaSolca 2014; J Fu 2015; Sundarenson 2018). 

(Wu,Berkow 2013) mentions that RMANOVA special, more constrained case of LV SEM and that LV models more flexible, better fit

Several studies used a similar method using Bayesian LV models to get around normality assumption

## Thesis Questions 

I am interested in the similarities in phenotypes during a pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) in children. 

Specifically, my main questions are:

(1) how many latent classes are there/can we build these classes using LC analysis?

- In Brandie's work there were 4 clusters from random forest -- point of reference

(2) When we build these classes what covariates are associated with our clusters?

- Start with just age

(3) [Optional] How does the Latent Class model compare with 2-stage models

- If clinical findings for (1) and (2) not interesting

## Methods 

I am looking to build a multivariate latent class mixed model, which can adjust for fixed effects and random effects due to within-subject correlation to identify phenotypes (# latent classes). 

### Building a Latent Class Linear Mixed Model (Proust 2017)
#### LMM recap
Recall that for a sample of $n$ subjects with $r_i$ repeated measures $Y_{ij}$, the outcome value for subject $i$ at the $rth$ measurement at time $t_{ij}$, the linear mixed model is as follows:

$Y_{ij} = X(t_{ij})^T \beta + Z_i(t_{ij})^T b_{i} + w_{i}(t_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij}$,

Where $\beta$ is our vector of fixed effects and $b$ is our vector of random effects. Trajectory shapes in $X$ and $Z$ can be "of any type such as polynomial, specifically designed to fit, or approximated using basis of I-Splines." 

The random effects vector $b_i$ has a zero-mean MVN distribution with unspecified covariance structure. Measurement errors $\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent Normal errors with variance $\sigma^2_\epsilon$. The process $w_{i}(t)$ is a zero-mean Gaussian stochastic process or a stationary process with parameter $\sigma^2_w$(note: this is included in semiparametric lmm, not regular parametric lmm from BIOS6643, and is used to model serial correlation)

In the LMM, we assume Normally distributed deviations (measurement errors, random effects, correlated errors) and constant covariate effects across time. However, these assumptions do not hold for many outcomes, especially in the microbiome where an outcome is a count.

# include what is a latent variable section here?
#### Latent Process Mixed Model

Thus, Proust defines a family of models, the "latent process mixed models" as "separating the structural model that describes the quantity of interest (latent process) according to time and covariates from the measurement model that links the quantity of interest to the observations."

Define the latent process $\Lambda_i(t)$ as a standard linear mixed model without measurement error:

$\Lambda_i(t) = X(t_{ij})^T \beta + Z_i(t_{ij})^T b_{i} + w_{i}(t_{ij})$

In order to account for different types of longitudinal markers (nonnormal), a link function $H$ between the latent process $\Lambda_i(t_{ij})$ and the outcome $Y_{ij}$ at time $t_{ij}$:

$Y_{ij} = H(\Lambda_i(t_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij} |\eta)$

Where $\eta$ are the parameters to the link function which transforms outcomes to Normally distributed to fit framework of standard LMM.

in package: linear transformation to gaussian framework, rescale Y to (0,1) and use beta CDF, basis of quadratic I-splines

The latent process mixed model constrains the location of $\beta_0 = 0$ and the scale $\sigma^2_\epsilon =1$

#### latent process mixed model for multivariate longitudinal markers

The previous model extends to the multivariate case involving multiple longitudinal markers (eg. different bacteria taxa), and the latent process is the common factor underlying the markers.

In this case, we can include covariates with marker-specific effects called contrasts (sum of coefficients = 0)

Each marker relationship with underlying quantity of interest is modeled through its own link function $H_k$ similar to previous section.

similar constraints to previous section; although this also requires a random intercept, and no mean intercept is allowed in the structural model.

### Latent Class Mixed Models

Assume a heterogenous population with $G$ latent classes of subjects, where each subject belongs to one class. Then $C_i$ is a discrete random variable that equals $g$ when subject i belongs to latent class $g$. 

the probability of $C_i = g$ is a class-specific probability, but can also be described using a multinomial logistic regression model with me-independent covariates $X_{c_i}$

For a Normal outcome $Y_{ij}$ in class $g$, the linear mixed model is:

$Y_{ij|c_i=g} = X(t_{ij})^T \beta + Z_i(t_{ij})^T b_{ig} + w_{i}(t_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij}$,

Where X are fixed effects (can be split into common and class-specific), Z are individual random effects, w is a normal autocorrelation process, and $\epsilon$ is random noise.

extended to a latent process model:

$\Lambda_{ij|c_i=g} = X(t_{ij})^T \beta + Z_i(t_{ij})^T u_{ig} + w_{i}(t_{ij})$

The distribution of u is class specific $u_{ij} \sim MVN(0, \omega_g^2 B)$ where B is an unspecified VCOV matrix. and w is a class-specific coefficient to allow class-specific individual variability

this model assumes the population heterogeneity only affects the underlying latent process of interest

the parameters to be estimated: Fixed effects, Random effects, variance of w, variance of the errors, parameters for beta transformation (link for outcome to latent process, p(c = g), w)( quite a few parameters).

### Estimation of parameters and likelihoods

The individual contribution to the likelihood of a lcmm is:

$L_i(\theta_G) = \sum^G_{g = 1}Pr(c_i = g)\phi_{ig}(Y_i|c_i =g ; \theta_G)$

Where $C$ is a random variable that equals $g$ when the subject belongs to latent class $g$, and $\phi_{ig} \sim MVN(X(t_{ij})^T\beta, Z_iBZ_i^T + R_i)$

I will need to decide before fitting the model which covariates I will include, and what kind of random effects to include.

For primary models, we will fit only using age to see if we can build classes with the model.

In order to fit this model, we need our outcomes to be normalized. For compositional data, two common transformations are the centered logratio transformation and the isometric logratio transformation. While the CLR transformation is more simple to compute and interpret, the resulting parts sums to 0, which may lead to singularity issues in model fitting. Because of this the ILR (which does not run into singularity issues at the cost of interpretabilty) will be used.
