# Latent Class Model in the Airway Microbiome

## Introduction

The application of latent class analysis to the microbiome is still relatively novel; not a lot of recent application, especially incorporating mixed components, to airways. 

I am interested in the similarities in phenotypes during a pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) in children. Our data are swabs on ~200 infants who were followed over several years (> 5 time points) with a relatively low # of taxa (could categorize into 4 groups), and demographic, clinical, etc. also recorded.

Specifically, my main questions are:

(1) how many latent classes are there/can we build these classes using covariates?

- In parent publication there were 4 clusters from random forest

(2) When we build these classes what covariates are associated with our clusters?

## Methods 

I am looking to build a multivariate latent class mixed model, which can adjust for fixed effects and random effects due to within-subject correlation to identify phenotypes (# latent classes).

I will need to decide before fitting the model which covariates I will include, and what kind of random effects to include.

In order to fit this model, we need our outcomes to be normalized. For compositional data, two common transformations are the centered logratio transformation and the isometric logratio transformation. While the CLR transformation is more simple to compute and interpret, the resulting parts sums to 0, which may lead to singularity issues in model fitting. Because of this the ILR (which does not run into singularity issues at the cost of interpretabilty) will be used.
