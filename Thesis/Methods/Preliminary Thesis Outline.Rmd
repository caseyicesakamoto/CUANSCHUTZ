# Latent Class Model in the Airway Microbiome

## Introduction

### Cf relevance- why do we care about CF & lungs - in kids

Cf is most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disease in US (1 in 4000 newborns in US, higher in some european countries) Farrell 2017

CF pulmonary disease begins early, and can progreess rapidly without early identification. (goetz 2019) 

Identifying phenotypes based on airway microbiome community composition may help us specialize treatment for patients with these distinct phenotypes

### Motivating example

BONUS study 

### intro to the method to be used

The application of latent class analysis to the microbiome is still relatively novel; not a lot of recent application, especially incorporating mixed components, to airways. 

I am interested in the similarities in phenotypes during a pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) in children. Our data are swabs on ~200 infants who were followed over several years (> 5 time points) with a relatively low # of taxa (could categorize into 4 groups), and demographic, clinical, etc. also recorded.

### why we chose thisparticular nethod

## Thesis Questions 

Specifically, my main questions are:

(1) how many latent classes are there/can we build these classes using covariates?

- In parent publication there were 4 clusters from random forest

(2) When we build these classes what covariates are associated with our clusters?

## Methods 

I am looking to build a multivariate latent class mixed model, which can adjust for fixed effects and random effects due to within-subject correlation to identify phenotypes (# latent classes).

I will need to decide before fitting the model which covariates I will include, and what kind of random effects to include.

In order to fit this model, we need our outcomes to be normalized. For compositional data, two common transformations are the centered logratio transformation and the isometric logratio transformation. While the CLR transformation is more simple to compute and interpret, the resulting parts sums to 0, which may lead to singularity issues in model fitting. Because of this the ILR (which does not run into singularity issues at the cost of interpretabilty) will be used.
